Schlage is a problem from damctf 2020, If you want the binary and any other script files I wrote associated with the write-up [Click Here](https://github.com/azorfus/azorfus.github.io/tree/blog/_posts/2024-03-26-Schlage-Reverse-Engineering)
You won't be able to find the binary at the [source](https://ctftime.org/task/13347) anymore (atleast I wasn't able to).
