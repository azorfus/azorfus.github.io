Vortex is a set of challenges consisting of 27 levels on [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/vortex/)

I'll be attempting to solve the challenges and will post the solutions to each level on this very blog post, Starting from
15th April 2024. You can find all the scripts that I write [here](https://github.com/azorfus/azorfus.github.io/tree/blog/resources/overthewire.org/vortex)



## Level 0
Trivial.
```py
# Solution script
import socket
import struct

handle = socket.socket()
connect = handle.connect(("vortex.labs.overthewire.org", 5842))

s = 0
for i in range(0, 4):
	# One unsigned integer is 4 bytes big
	s = s + int(struct.unpack("I", handle.recv(4))[0])

handle.send(struct.pack("I", s))
print(handle.recv(1024))
```
