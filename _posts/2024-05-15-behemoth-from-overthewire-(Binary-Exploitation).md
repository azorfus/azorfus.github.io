Behemoth is a set of challenges consisting of 8 levels on [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/behemoth/)

I'll be attempting to solve the challenges and will post the solutions to each level on this very blog post, Starting from
14th May 2024. You can find all the scripts that I write [here](https://github.com/azorfus/azorfus.github.io/tree/blog/resources/overthewire.org/behemoth)

## Level 0
Very simple challenge.

Our flag is an obfuscated string stored in memory. It's unobfuscated at runtime with the memfrob() function
which xor's each character with 42. Its easy to write a reverse script to which you can feed the obfuscated
string to, You can get it by poking into memory with gdb.

Reverse script:
```py
inp = input("> ")
solved = ""
for i in inp:
	solved = solved + chr(ord(i)^42)
print(solved)
```
Entering the obfuscate string we get our flag.
