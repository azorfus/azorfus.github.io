Hi.
I'm azorfus, a highschool student from India. I write code mostly in C/C++ and Python, and occasionally x86/x86_64 intel assembly (Yes, I can write code in assembly :P)
Recently, I've been working on reverse engineering puzzles and bin-exp challenges from various sources. (Refer the Resources page).
