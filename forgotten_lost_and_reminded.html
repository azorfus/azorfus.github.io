    <h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgotten, Lost and Reminded</span></h1>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short story written by Eniyan</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">December 21, 2025</span></p>
    <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writer&rsquo;s note: This work of mine is rather heavily inspired by Johnathan Nolan&rsquo;s short story, Memento Mori. Although there is little to none conceptual or plot similarity, something heavily inspired me to write this after reading what I consider one of the best-written works I&rsquo;ve ever come across. Hence, you might notice some similarities in the writing style to that of John&rsquo;s work.</span></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YOU OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE WARM SUN ON YOUR FACE. There&rsquo;s a flock of crows screaming outside for whatever reason they usually do. &ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo; you voice with frustration. Another agonizing afternoon, another day where you wake up feeling like you got shot in the head. The rum ran out. What about the giant red bottle of vodka? You peek out to the side of your bed, that&rsquo;s where you usually put your huge bottle of Russian spirit, it&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake. God save my fucking soul,&rdquo; words shatter from your mouth with more frustration. The room is a mess. You look straight up at the ceiling, a dark brown ceiling fan spins slowly, and the room is cold. You didn&rsquo;t feel cold until now, your body was so busy recovering from the toxic party you gave it last night that it couldn&rsquo;t care to focus on how cold it was around you. The sheets are thrown across the floor. &ldquo;The hell happened here?&rdquo; you exclaim with confusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get up out of your bed and walk towards the door into the living room. It&rsquo;s a mess outside, too. Food drying out on plates for god knows how long, and bottles scattered all across the floor. Oh! There lies your bottle of vodka. Too bad that it&rsquo;s empty, it&rsquo;s all gone. You drank it all away yesterday. It was a little too much, a lot more than usual. It&rsquo;s all under control, usually. You have your little system that keeps track of how drunk you get and how you go on with your day with the perfect amount of booze to satisfy your mind&rsquo;s endless tantrums.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It got a little too much yesterday; you don&rsquo;t exactly remember what went down. But what you do remember to do is to take a piss. The bathroom door lies wide open, and a small light flickers above the mirror. You turn the smaller light off and switch on the main lights. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s much better,&rdquo; you mutter. Yeah, it is. Blue and lifeless fluorescent lights to make your goddamn afternoon feel more psychotic than it already is. There are multiple cuts and bandages across your face; it seems like you got yourself in a messy fight recently. Doesn&rsquo;t feel new; it rather feels very much like you. The pathetic piece of shit that you&rsquo;ve become, drowning away in alcohol every awake minute of your life.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s none of your concern now; all you care about is brushing your teeth and getting rid of that awful rotting taste in your mouth. You grab your brush, apply a smudge of paste to it, and proceed to rake your teeth like you&rsquo;re cleaning shit off a tar road. The water turns brown as you wash your mouth out. It feels much better now; it smells nice. You can feel the cool mint flavor in your mouth. The day feels better, maybe today can be a wonder after all, and not the usual shit show it is. God, you&rsquo;re grumpy, aren&rsquo;t you, not too shabby for a pathetic loser. You&rsquo;re supposed to be loathing in self-pity enough not to feel anything but your failure of a life. But it seems like you&rsquo;ve got some life left in you.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You hurry yourself out of the bathroom to avoid the stench of bleach that&rsquo;s burning your nose now. You bleached the floor yesterday when you were drunk, you felt the need to be &ldquo;clean&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve made worse decisions before. I guess you don&rsquo;t have to think too much about this one.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s a muffled ringing; it&rsquo;s a phone. It&rsquo;s yours, and you can almost hear the buzzing that comes along with the annoying ring. You follow the sound to your room, the phone&rsquo;s sitting on the one wooden cabinet with a broken door in the corner of your room. There&rsquo;s a pack of cigarettes beside it. You ignore the phone for a moment and pick up the pack. It reads: CHERRY CHAMES&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not your favorite brand, but it does the job well. And it&rsquo;s smooth. You pull out a cigarette and the thin lighter along with it. Pop it in your mouth and LIGHT it. The tobacco burns as you inhale the smoke. It feels good, you feel a little relief finally. You don&rsquo;t have to feel like jumping off that brightly shining window anymore. You stash the pack into your pocket. The phone stops ringing. You don&rsquo;t bother with it for a moment, after all, who could it be? It&rsquo;s not gonna be important enough for it to be able to disrupt your harmonious moment with the lit tobacco. It&rsquo;s not her anymore, she isn&rsquo;t gonna call you, it's all done for, there is no her anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You finally pick up your phone and check what made it cry for your attention. It wasn&rsquo;t a call, it&rsquo;s a reminder you&rsquo;ve set for yourself with the same music as the caller tone so you&rsquo;d care enough to check. The reminder reads: CHECK THE LATEST VIDEO IN THE GALLERY YOU DUMBASS&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You click on the little icon with the text GALLERY written beneath it, a video appears on the top left corner of the broken screen. The small text on it clearly tells you that it's about 50 seconds long. You click on it, you can hear yourself speaking, the phone&rsquo;s camera is shaky. You seem to be walking, &ldquo;HEY DUMBFUCK!&rdquo; you exclaim. &ldquo;HERE&rsquo;S YOUR BOTTLE OF RUM, I KNOW YOU WON&rsquo;T REMEMBER. GO GET IT&rdquo; you scream to yourself as you stash a nice big bottle of rum into the lower left door of the same broken cabinet that stands before you. &ldquo;AND THE PACK OF CHERRY CHAMES SITS ON TOP OF THE CABINET, JUST IN CASE YOU&rsquo;RE BLIND. P.S. YOUR DRUNK SELF&rdquo; you speak as you record yourself pointing at the pack of cigarettes on the cabinet. You open the bottom left door of the cabinet with a subtle excitement for life. There it is! A half filled bottle of rum. Your favorite spirit. God it&rsquo;s such a better day now isn&rsquo;t it? You immediately unscrew the cap and gulp at the white liquid. It burns your throat. It almost brings the heat back to your life. Your eyes widen and you feel lighter. You put the bottle down and take a moment to breathe. The alcohol burns through your system.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SILENCE. That&rsquo;s all you can hear now. Silence. You feel icky and filthy. That&rsquo;s what you are, filth. You run back to the bathroom, turn on the tap on the tiny sink, and start mauling your face with water. Rubbing it all over with your hands to get rid of the filth. It works for a while; the ice-cold water seems to do something to you. You look up at yourself in the mirror and wipe away the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; you sigh and grab the electric razor from the corner of the sink. The mild buzz from the razor soothes you somewhat. You take a good long look at yourself and go at your hair, you make long straight strokes. The hair falls off in chunks. You keep going until there&rsquo;s nothing but patterns of your unprofessional barbery left on your head. Your scalp shines white through the buzzed hair.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; you mutter. There&rsquo;s a smile on your face. You feel satisfied. Every time you look at your face, you&rsquo;ll be reminded of how big a self-loathing shit you are. The magic of alcohol finally gets to you. You feel mildly tipsy after chugging down about half a bottle of neat white rum. You know it&rsquo;ll get worse, you know you&rsquo;re going to be VERY TIPSY as your body slowly processes the ravaging toxin.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You walk back to your couch and fall on it. THUMP&ndash;dust fills the air. There&rsquo;s a folded piece of paper on the coffee table before you. You reach out to it. &ldquo;Argh fuck!&rdquo; you cry as your back holds you hostage with pain. You finally pick it up, and the paper is yellow from the sunlight. Looks like it&rsquo;s been here for a while now, the sun shines bright through the window that goes directly opposite the couch. The paper has been thawing in the heat for a good deal now. The paper is crisp; you unfold it, there&rsquo;s writing on it. It&rsquo;s pretty. The handwriting is pretty. You&rsquo;d assume it's of an elegant woman. Of course it is, it&rsquo;s hers. This is why you went spiraling yesterday. But that&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;re strong now. You stretch it open and start reading.</span></p>
