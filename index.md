## Hello, I’m Azorfus 👾

Welcome to my corner of the internet — a dumping ground for random research, eerie ideas, and digital experiments.

### What I Do

I’m into:

- Reverse engineering strange things
- Building odd tools that almost no one needs
- Writing posts that blur the line between documentation and diary
- Exploring weird corners of computing history
