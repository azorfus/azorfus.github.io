# TimeLess (UnderDev)
A small custom debugger that I'm writing for linux in C. Uses [udis86](https://github.com/vmt/udis86) for the dissassembler. The goal is to make a very light weight debugger that lets me solve my reverse engineering and binexp challenges, It includes a graph view for disassembly and provides execution flow paths. The feature that'll be added last but the most important: Reverse Debugging. [Repository for TimeLess.](https://github.com/azorfus/TimeLess)

# Zerl (UnderDev)
A simple custom interpreted language written in C/C++, The goal is to learn programming language theory and how parsers work, Supports math calculations, if else statements, while loops, for loops, functions, strings and basic input/output. It's a work underdevelopment. [Repository for Zerl.](https://github.com/azorfus/Zerl)

# ZGClib (UnderDev)
Idk what this is completely going to be lol. The main idea is to implement vectors and strings from C++ to C using custom garbage collection.

# Miscellaneous. 

## Server - Client chat system 
A simple server - client IRC chat system I wrote for my school project, It contains a very shaky file transfer feature which doesn't have much use :P.

## LeD 
A simple line editor inspired by edlin I wrote back in the day to understand string manipulation in C which led me to write a not very efficient [string library](https://github.com/azorfus/StringLib). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/azorfus/Led).
