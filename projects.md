# TimeLess (UnderDev) (2024)
A small custom debugger that I'm writing for linux in C. Uses [udis86](https://github.com/vmt/udis86) for the dissassembler. The goal is to make a very light weight debugger that lets me solve my reverse engineering and bin-exp challenges, It includes a graph view for disassembly and provides execution flow paths. The feature that'll be added last but the most important: Reverse Debugging. [Repository for TimeLess.](https://github.com/azorfus/TimeLess)

# Zerl (UnderDev) (2023 - 24)
A simple custom interpreted language written in C/C++, The goal is to learn programming language theory and how parsers work, Supports math calculations, if else statements, while loops, for loops, functions, strings and basic input/output. It's a work underdevelopment. [Repository for Zerl.](https://github.com/azorfus/Zerl)

# Zarena (UnderDev) (2024)
A custom library for implementing garbage collected strings and vectors (from C++) in C. (Zarena -> Z Arena)

# Miscellaneous. 

## Server - Client chat system (2023)
A simple server - client IRC chat system I wrote for my school project, It contains a very shaky file transfer feature which doesn't have much use :P.

## LeD (2021 - 2022)
A simple line editor inspired by edlin I wrote back in the day to understand string manipulation in C which led me to write a not very efficient [string library](https://github.com/azorfus/StringLib). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/azorfus/Led).
