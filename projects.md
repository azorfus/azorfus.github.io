# Ztrace (UnderDev) (2024)
A simple debugging utility for linux that I'm writing in C with the help of ptrace. The goal of the project is to create a tool that provides a rough summary of the memory, function calls (jumps) with breakpoints and to learn how debugging works in the linux kernel.

# Zerl (Halt) (2023 - 24)
A simple custom interpreted language written in C/C++, The goal is to learn programming language theory and how parsers work. Supports math calculations, if else statements, while loops, for loops, functions, strings and basic input/output. It's a work underdevelopment.

# Zarena (UnderDev) (2024)
A custom library for implementing garbage collected strings and vectors (from C++) in C. (Zarena -> Z Arena)

# Miscellaneous. 

## Server - Client chat system (2023)
A simple server - client IRC chat system I wrote for my school project, It contains a very shaky file transfer feature which doesn't have much use :P.

## LeD (2021 - 2022)
A simple line editor inspired by edlin I wrote back in the day to understand string manipulation in C which led me to write a not very efficient [string library](https://github.com/azorfus/StringLib). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/azorfus/Led).
