### Zerl (UnderDev) — 2025  
A low-level systems programming language written in Rust.

Zerl is a minimal, statically typed language targeting bare-metal RISC-V platforms. It's built from scratch with a focus on simplicity, compiler design, and close-to-metal execution. Key components include:

- A hand-written parser and IR
- Backend that emits RISC-V assembly directly
- Explicit memory and register control
- Tensor and matrix types as first-class primitives (for ML support)
- Minimal runtime and bootloader-level integration

The project serves as a deep dive into compiler internals, architecture-specific codegen, and systems-level software design.

### RL-Sandbox  
A personal research environment for studying reinforcement learning.

RL-Sandbox includes hand-built RL engines and algorithm implementations in Python. It’s designed to support foundational learning and experimentation. The project includes:

- Custom RL engines (e.g., 15-puzzle, gridworld, gambler’s problem)
- Implementations of Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-Learning, SARSA
- Instrumentation for step-by-step debugging and performance tracking
- Tools for visualizing agent behavior and learning progress

The project serves as a base for writing devlogs, studying algorithm behavior, and experimenting with variations of classic reinforcement problems.

# Miscellaneous. 

## Server - Client chat system (2023)
A simple server - client IRC chat system I wrote for my school project, It contains a very shaky file transfer feature which doesn't have much use :P.

## LeD (2021 - 2022)
A simple line editor inspired by edlin I wrote back in the day to understand string manipulation in C which led me to write a not very efficient [string library](https://github.com/azorfus/StringLib). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/azorfus/Led).
